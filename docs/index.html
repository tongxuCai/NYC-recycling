Among these districts are the wealthiest in the city, which the city’s targeted education campaigns have glossed over.</p>
</div> <div class="story-body scrollytelling"> <h2 class="chart-headline">Poverty-stricken Districts Have Led the Charge</h2> <p class="chart-description">New York as a whole is recycling more, up from a diversion rate of 17% in 2009 to 19% in 2018. The jump is largely thanks to high-poverty community districts, where targeted community outreach played a role in boosting diversion rates.</p> <input class="slider" id="myRange"> <div id="slider-range"></div> <div id="chart-change" class="chart"></div> <div class="steps"> <div class="step" id="step1"> <p>The city's current state of recycling has been years in the making, with notable increases starting around 2011, according to DSNY spokesperson Belinda Mager.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step2"> <p>The push was fueled by the poverty-stricken districts that recycled considerably more, particularly in the Bronx.</p> <p class="note">**High poverty rate defined as greater than 15%</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step2"> <p>The Department of Sanitation's concerted education efforts with neighborhood institutions in the last decade helped bridge cultural barriers, such as language, in these areas, according to Espinoza.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step3"> <p>But when it came to districts that are recycling less, the five culprits were spread across lower Manhattan, Staten Island and Brooklyn.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step-"> <p>The two chart-topping districts are among the high-wealth cluster in lower Manhattan and northwestern Brooklyn.</p> <p class="note">**High income defined as a district having a median household income of greater than $90,000. The city's median is nearly $58,000, per the Census.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step4"> <p>These Manhattan districts, CD 1 and CD 6, faced the starkest drops. They’re also extremely wealthy.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step5"> <p>The greatest fall was in the elite Community District 1, which contains Wall Street, Tribeca and Battery Park City. The district's diversion rate fell six percentage points, from 53% in 2009 to 47% in 2018.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="step5"> <p>It's also tied for the wealthiest in the city with a median household income of $121,000, more than double the city's median of nearly $58,000.</p> </div> </div>
</div> <div class="story-body"> <p>The regressions contradict New York’s dream of contributing zero waste to landfills by 2030, which was forged in 2015 with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s wide-reaching OneNYC <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/257-15/mayor-de-blasio-releases-one-new-york-plan-strong-just-city#/0" target="_blank">plan</a>. The city’s Zero Waste NYC program, an arm of the Department of Sanitation, has since been tasked with educating residents, which has so far included partnering with community institutions for events. DSNY also recently launched a lofty advertising <a href="https://www.nycrecycles.org/" target="_blank">campaign</a> in the subway, complete with puns and innocuous graphics.</p> <p>Sociologists, environmental advocates and city officials are stumped as to why these five districts have reported decreases. But Adriana Espinoza, New York City Program director for the New York League of Conservation Voters, said it comes down to the program not being prioritized. Born out of the same OneNYC plan was <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/content/visionzero/pages/" target="_blank">Vision Zero</a> , the heavily marketed initiative to curb traffic accidents and fatalities.</p><p> </p><p>“Targeted community outreach and engagement is important, but we think there should be a city-wide public service initiative,” Espinoza said. “Basically the same as the way you see Vision Zero signs in the subways and at bus stops and on radio commercials.”</p>
</div> <script src="pct_change.e5bb1865.js"></script> <div class="story-body"> <h2 class="chart-headline">Environmental Influencers</h2> <p class="story-body">After New York City officials <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/us/new-york-city-declared-climate-emergency-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">declared</a> a climate emergency in June, Nicole Grossberg decided to join the zero-waste education effort. Grossberg, a lifelong New Yorker who was a content strategist by trade, had been living a zero-waste lifestyle for years. Eventually, all of her work projects, which largely comprised social media management and advertising copywriting, started to revolve around going green.</p> <p class="story-body">After a layoff in summer 2018, Grossberg, an Astoria resident, shifted to freelance work, where she had more control over the projects and messages. In her spare time, she dreamed of hosting her own workshops to help others go green.</p> <p class="story-body">“I always kept putting it off and I feel like the universe was giving me all these signs along the way,’ Grossberg said. “So the summer of 2018, I had yet another layoff. It was like the second one in three years. And I kinda just took it as a sign from the universe that at that point was just screaming at me to follow my passion and do what I really wanted to do. So I decided to go off on my own.“</p> <p class="story-body">She teamed up in August 2019 with Sandra Noonan, another zero-waste New Yorker, and began <a href="https://www.zerowastenyc.info/" target="_blank">Zero Waste NYC Workshop Series</a>, a monthly lecture series aimed at educating audience members on how to reduce, reuse, recycle, and if all else fails, refuse. Right off the bat, the duo paired with DSNY’s nonprofit, The Foundation for New York’s Strongest, which involves teaming with DSNY for certain events. In <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zero-waste-nyc-workshop-series-fashion-beauty-tickets-86258857565" target="_blank">February</a>, the Series is teaming with DSNY as a part of the city’s ReFashion Week program for a panel discussion on textile waste in the fashion industry.</p> <p class="story-body">Admittedly, Grossberg said her audience is primarily those who have an interest in living a zero-waste lifestyle, which could only make a small dent in the city’s diversion numbers. Grossberg estimates there are typically about 45 attendees at each event, strong enough for DSNY to invite the Series into a formal partnership.</p> <p class="story-body">“One of the tricks is to get the people who could really make a big difference,” Grossberg said. “I would love to have more of an audience that doesn’t know anything about zero waste. I just haven’t found the right way to reach everyone yet. It would be the people who don’t know much about it.”</p> <p class="story-body">But to really tackle the bottom line, efforts need to reach the other 8.4 million New Yorkers who don’t have an inclination toward a more sustainable lifestyle. To inch toward all of them, Grossberg set up the workshops so all of the attendees leave as zero waste ambassadors - or influencers, as she calls them - to educate neighbors, friends and followers.</p> <p class="story-body">“If we can't reach those people, then we want the people that come to our workshops to be influencers,” Grossberg said. “We want to encourage people to go out there and spread the message. We give them tools on how they can talk to other people without seeming like they're being preachy and aggressive about their beliefs.”</p> <p class="story-body">But New York’s waste problem runs deeper than recycling; piles of garbage line are known to line streets all throughout the boroughs, leaving its signature stench. A 2015 <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/112/19/5985.full.pdf" target="_blank">study</a> found there's good reason for the both of these: New York is the most wasteful city in the world.</p> <p class="story-body">More specifically, the study, which detailed the energy and material flows of 27 megacities across the world, found that New York emits more trash than any other megacity in the world. The study found that the city that never sleeps produced about 34 megatons of waste in 2011, more than triple the second place Mexico City.</p>
